                    <h3 class="headings mt-4">What are FIPs?</h3>
                    <p class="detail-text">Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs) are standards specifying potential new
                        features or processes for
                        Filecoin. FIPs contain technical specifications for the proposed changes and act as the “source
                        of
                        truth” for the community. Network upgrades and application standards for Filecoin are discussed
                        and
                        developed through the FIP process.
                        <br>
                        Anyone within the Filecoin community has the ability to create an FIP. Guidelines for writing
                        FIPs are
                        included in FIP 1. The FIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and
                        its
                        rationale. The FIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
                        documenting
                        dissenting opinions. Given the high technical bar for submitting a well-formed FIP,
                        historically, most
                        FIP authors have been application or protocol developers.</p>



                    <h3 class="headings mt-4">Why do FIPs matter?</h3>
                    <p class="detail-text">FIPs play a central role in how changes happen and are documented on
                        Filecoin. They are the way for
                        people to propose, debate, and adopt changes. There are different types of FIPs, such as core
                        FIPs for
                        low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade. Every network
                        upgrade
                        consists of a set of FIPs that need to be implemented by each Filecoin client on the network.
                        This
                        implies that to stay in consensus with other clients on the Filecoin mainnet, client developers
                        need to
                        make sure they have all implemented the required FIPs.</p>

                    <p class="detail-text">Along with providing a technical specification for changes, FIPs are the unit
                        around which governance
                        happens in Filecoin: anyone is free to propose one, and then various stakeholders in the
                        community will
                        discuss to determine whether it should be adopted as a standard or included in a network
                        upgrade.
                        Non-core FIPs don't have to be adopted by all applications, but core FIPs must be widely adopted
                        (because all nodes must upgrade to stay part of the same network) -- therefore core FIPs require
                        broader
                        consensus within the community than non-core FIPs.</p>

                    <h3 class="headings mt-4">History of FIPs</h3>
                    <p class="detail-text">The Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs) Github repository was created in
                        March 2019 and launched in
                        September 2020. The FIP process is based on the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) process,
                        which is
                        itself based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process and the Python Enhancement
                        Proposals
                        (PEPs) process.</p>
